This script simualate code calltips in a new bottow window of Vim.
In fact, it display python help doc strings of word under the cursor
by scanning the imported modules in the current file.
this file Reference :    http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=73 

Note: Because Python language is dynamic and the type of object is certain 
         when running, the calltips is only displayed for the part of all object.   

It require Python and Vim compiled with "+python" 
and MAKE SURE "set iskeyword+=."
    
It work well in my box in Win2000/XP + Vim6.3 + python2.3. 
It can also work in GNU/Linux.
Note: as I know, Vim6.2 come into conflict with Python2.3, becase Vim6.2
         is compiled with Python2.1. you can update vim version to 6.3.
        Maybe yours not.

More detail is in the header of script file. 

I write a tip(vimtip #778) about the script for all Pythoner. I wish you enjoy it.
